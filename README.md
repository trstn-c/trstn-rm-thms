# trstn-rm-thms
- Hello there, I'm Trstn. I'm a maker currently studying for BFA.
- I haven't been using Roam for a long time yet but figured I oughtta play around with theming since I already love the app
- This is a repo for my roam theming work and experimentation
- I only know CSS from playing around making quick websites on and off. I don't really know what I'm doing
- Any critique or suggestions or help with any aspect of a theme that I'm struggling with is appreciated

## Themes
- Currently I have two themes that are somewhat presentable
  - Minima, which aims to minimal but still keep functionality
  and
  - el-n, which is minimal but not overly so and focuses more on function over form

## ðŸ¤¯ In progress:
- Making things DRYer
