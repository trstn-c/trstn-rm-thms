# trstn-rm-thms
Hello there, I'm Trstn. I'm a maker currently studying at AUA for a BFA. Yet to decide on a major.
I haven't been using Roam for a long time yet but figured I oughtta play around with theming since I already love the app.
This is a repo for my roam theming work and experimentation.
I only know CSS from playing around making quick websites on and off.
Bit out of my depths but intently trying to figure things out.

Any critique or suggestions or help with any aspect of a theme that I'm struggling with is appreciated

## Themes
- Currently I have two themes that are somewhat presentable
  - **Minima**, which aims to be minimal but still keep functionality
  - and
  - **el-n**, which is minimal but not overly so and focuses more on function over form

## ðŸ¤¯ In progress:
- Making things DRYer
- Alignments
- Some other details that can be found in the .sass files
