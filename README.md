- Hello there, I'm Trstn. I'm a maker currently studying for BFA.
- I haven't been using Roam for a long time yet but figured I oughtta play around with theming since I already love the app
- This is a repo for my roam theming work and experimentation
- I only know CSS from playing around making quick websites on and off. I don't really know what I'm doing
- Any critique or suggestions or help with any aspect of a theme that I'm struggling with is appreciated

## ðŸ¤¯ In progress:
- Making things DRYer
